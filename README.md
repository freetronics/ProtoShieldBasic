A minimalist general-purpose prototyping shield for the Arduino
Duemilanove, TwentyTen, and other compatible boards based on the same
header format.

This design is intended to maximise prototyping area by extending the
plain pads right to the ends of the board, which also makes it easier
to fit horizontal PCB-mount sockets that need to overlap the edge.

Note that this design is intended for simple fabrication and assembly,
and does not have many of the features of other prototyping shields
such as the "ProtoShield" (also available from Freetronics) such as
general-purpose LEDs.

Features:

 * Pads for reset button connected to Arduino reset pin.
 * Pads for two 100nF smoothing capacitors.
 * Pads for "power on" LED and current-limiting resistor.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.
