A minimalist, general-purpose prototyping shield for the Arduino
Duemilanove microcontroller and other boards based on the same header
format, such as the TwentyTen, Seeeduino, and Arduino Pro.

This design is intended to maximise prototyping area by extending the
plain pads right to the ends of the board, which also makes it easier
to fit horizontal PCB-mount sockets that need to overlap the edge.

Features:

 * Reset button wired through to Arduino reset pin.
 * Pads for 2 x 100nF smoothing capacitors.
 * Pads for "power on" LED and current-limiting resistor.
 * Parts overlay on both the top and the bottom so you can see what you
   are connecting without having to keep turning the board over.


INSTALLATION
------------
The design is saved as an EAGLE project. EAGLE PCB design software is
available from www.cadsoftusa.com free for non-commercial use. To use
this project download it and place the directory containing these files
into the "eagle" directory on your computer. Then open EAGLE and
navigate to Projects -> eagle -> ProtoShield.
